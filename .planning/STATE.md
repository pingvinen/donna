## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Distribution-first — build full packaging/CI/CD pipeline with stub donna:setup before real features
- [Roadmap]: 4 phases: distribution → capture → daily rhythm → external enrichment
- [Roadmap]: donna:setup used as hello-world skill (not a throwaway dummy)
- [Roadmap]: Migration system must handle upgrades from any previous version (users skip intermediates)
- [Roadmap]: donna:log-meeting and donna:next deferred to v2
- [Roadmap]: Tools registry placed in Phase 4 since tools are only consumed by daily brief's external integration

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: The Task tool spawning pattern for `donna:set-role` research agent needs validation against current Claude Code behavior before building (flagged by research)
- [Phase 4]: Jira CLI ecosystem is fragmented -- needs targeted research at Phase 4 planning time
